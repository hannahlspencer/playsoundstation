Attracter – to attract players to start the game, music is always looped, and usually a version of one of the main themes
Startup – setting the scene and goal of the game
Situation – depends on genre eg. a board game will require a different style than a shooter.
Every situation requires looped music that must not be too monotonous after many repetitions
Transition – short, non-interactive scenes between levels, like start up
Success – when a near-term or ultimate goal is completed eg. getting a King in draughts is near-term, winning is ultimate;
killing all the enemies in an area is near, rescuing hostages is ultimate
Failure – when a player cannot complete the objective and needs to restart level

Closing credits – fixed length piece of music as credits roll
